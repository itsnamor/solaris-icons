This project is a wrapper around the beautiful Solar Icon Set created by 480 Design and licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1166831539721848736). We provide easy-to-use packages for popular frameworks to make these icons accessible to more developers.

Inspired by the excellent work of Phosphor Icons and Lucide Icons, whose projects set a high standard for icon libraries in the open-source community.
